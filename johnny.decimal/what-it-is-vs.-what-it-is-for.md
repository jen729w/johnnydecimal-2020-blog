# "What it is" vs. "what it is for"

A common question goes like this:

> I have my house insurance documentation. Should that be stored in a system like `Insurance > House` or `House > Insurance`?

The answer is: you just have to decide what feels right for you. There is no 'correct' answer here.

I tend to find that most of us prefer one way or the other. Go with that.

## That was a lame answer

Okay okay, there are other tricks. But you probably don't need them.

### Create links from one place to another

I invented JD while managing a [contemporary dance performance](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=suite+synergy+graeme+murphy) with a couple of friends. Four people have four different brains, so I thought I'd run in to this problem all of the time.

I imagined that I'd create shortcuts/symlinks/whatever in folders to automatically link to another folder. I never did â€“ people just figured it out. Maybe they had to ask me the first time, but then they remembered.

### Write little notes to yourself

This can help. A text file \(keep it simple! If I see you launching Word I'll come and chop your fingers off\) with a pointer to the 'other' folder is sometimes all it needs.
