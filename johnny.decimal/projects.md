# Multiple projects

When I [started this system](history/the-history-of-j-d.md) I was running a specific project, and I didn't really consider the need for multiple projects _on the same system_.

If two projects never meet, there's no problem. I have a project at work with one set of numbers and my system at home with another, totally unrelated, set of numbers. No problem at all â€“ it's like I'm two people leading separate lives.

Fast-forward a decade and I find myself needing more. I still have my personal system, but I work freelance and the projects I run for other people must exist alongside my personal stuff, and each other.

# Adding projects to the system

I've thought about this for a few years, and have been using the system I'll describe here since 2018. So far it's working well for me.

## Goals

The extended system must retain the advantages of the original Johnny.Decimal system.

1. Each item must have a unique identifier.
2. You must be able to search (your notes, your file system) for this identifier.
3. The identifier should be short and preferably memorable.

## Letters: no good

I tried systems using letters rather than numbers and they didn't work. My initial attempt looked something like this:

- HME.AC.ID = home system
- DVO.AC.ID = the DevOps project at work
- ETC.AC.ID = etc. for more projects

## Numbers
