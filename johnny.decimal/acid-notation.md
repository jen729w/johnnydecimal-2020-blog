# AC.ID notation

I can't believe it took me ten years to think of this. 🤦🏼‍♂️

When I'm referring to Johnny.Decimal numbers in the abstract – that is, I'm just referring to _any_ number, the system as a whole – I've been using `xx.yy` or `00.00` as a placeholder.

## Area Category ID = AC.ID

The number is, of course, made up of your area/category combo before the decimal, then the ID after.

So now when I refer to `AC.ID`, I just mean _any number in your system_.
