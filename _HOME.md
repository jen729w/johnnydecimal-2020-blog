description: What is this site?
---

I finally got a blog set up for Johnny.Decimal and then I realised [I didn't want a blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden).

Rather, this site is like the staging ground for JD. It's ideas, some of them very sketchy. It's where I'll keep my to-do lists for the site. It's my brain, basically, for all things JD.

Some things may start here and 'graduate' to proper articles on johnnydecimal.com. Or not. I want the main site to be as pure and clean as possible. This place, not so much.

## Johnny.Decimal vs. Technical articles

There'll be information about two distinct types of thing here. First, obviously, anything to do with the JD system itself. Those things are all under the **Johnny.Decimal** header.

Second, I'm teaching myself to code so that I can write some tools to _support_ the system. I'll keep notes about that separate, so if you're not in to JavaScript or what have you, you can just ignore that stuff and know you're not missing anything. This is all under the **JavaScript** header.

## What changed, when?

If you're interested, this site is stored on GitHub. The repository is public so you can [see all commits here](https://github.com/jen729w/johnnydecimal-2020-blog/commits/master).
