# Multiple projects

When I [started this system](history/the-history-of-j-d.md) I was running a specific project, and I didn't really consider the need for multiple projects _on the same system_.

If two projects never meet, there's no problem. I have a project at work with one set of numbers and my system at home with another, totally unrelated, set of numbers. No problem at all â€“ it's like I'm two people leading separate lives.

Fast-forward a decade and I find myself needing more. I still have my personal system, but I work freelance and the projects I run for other people must exist alongside my personal stuff, and each other.
