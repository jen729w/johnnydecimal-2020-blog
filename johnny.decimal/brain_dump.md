# Brain dump

## Brain dump

* Defining `AC.0x` as standard items, e.g. `00.00 Index`, `00.01 Inbox`.
  * And then re-implementing your own system this way.
* 'Unstructured thoughts' vs. blog.
  * Link to that series of articles you found.
* Using a number or a category as an inbox so you can _quickly_ dump an idea without having to go back to the system.
  * But now, like GTD, you have to **rigorously** review and organise.
  * Is it better to just leave a number off then do that?
